Our flagship programme, Mindfulness-Based Organisational Education (MBOE), brings people together to apply ‘social mindfulness’ as a catalyst for change.

### MBOE is a pioneering programme which explores:

* Mindfulness and group effects
* Language to describe experience
* Listening with awareness
* Decision making, identity and bias
* Mindfulness in courageous conversations
* Intention, resilience and purposeful action

## Leadership

{% include quote.html
	quote="I have learnt to allow more silence, particularly in difficult conversations. I have also learnt to accept and even encourage the voice of dissent from others.

	<br>
	I have learnt to control anxiety that historically has arisen when those working for me express dissatisfaction."

### What do participants take away?
* Self-awareness
* Understanding each other
* Confidence and trust
* Presence while listening
* Skilful communication
* Understanding the way &lsquo;group mind&rsquo; works


## How is it delivered?

The MBOE programme runs over six weeks. Classes come together each week for an hour and a quarter. Building relationships and meditating with peers during the programme plays and important role in bringing teams together.

The programme can also be provided as a one-day team-building workshop. For benefits comparable to the six-week format this day can be followed by individual and/or group meditation practice listening to recordings. 

All our programmes are supported by our [book][1], which includes links to guided meditations and clear explanations of the what, why and how of 'social mindfulness'.

## The evidence

MBOE has been tested under trial conditions with hospitals staff. It not only reduces stress, see Figure 2 from the paper published in the journal, Mindfulness, but increases Basic Psychological Needs at Work Scale (BPNWS), see Figure 1. BPNWS is a validated self-report scale from Self Determination Theory, which includes three elements: autonomy, competence and relatedness. 

This study makes MBOE one of only a small number of evidence-based programmes.
