## Mindfulness-Based Organisational Education (MBOE): An evidence-based organizational mindfulness programme

---

## Our approach

BPNWS is a validated self-report scale from Self Determination Theory, which includes three elements: autonomy, competence and relatedness. This study has been published in the journal, Mindfulness making our programme
