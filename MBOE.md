Little will change if mindfulness is merely applied as a means of coping with stress and enhancing individual performance. The Mindfulness Connected approach brings people together to apply ‘social mindfulness’ as a catalyst for change.

### A pioneering programme which explores:
* Group effects or workshop activities as experiential learning
* Theory that explains what, why and how of what is going on
* Developing language to describe experience
* Social/group meaning for mindfulness meditation

## Leadership

{% include quote.html
	quote="I have learnt to allow more silence, particularly in difficult conversations. I have also learnt to accept and even encourage the voice of dissent from others. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I have learnt to control anxiety that historically has arisen when those working for me express dissatisfaction."

### What do participants take away?
* Self-awareness
* Understanding each other
* Confidence and trust
* Presence while listening
* Skilful communication
* Understanding the way group mind works


## How is it delivered?
The MBOE programme runs over six weeks. Classes come together each week for an hour and a quarter. The programme is supported by our [book][1]. One-day team-building workshops can also be provided.

## The evidence

Our flagship programme, Mindfulness-Based Organisational Education (MBOE) has been tested under trial conditions with hospitals staff. It not only reduces stress, see Figure 2 from the paper published in the journal, Mindfulness, but increases Basic Psychological Needs at Work Scale (BPNWS), see Figure 1. BPNWS is a validated self-report scale from Self Determination Theory, which includes three elements: autonomy, competence and relatedness. This study has been published in the journal, Mindfulness making our programme
