title: Mindfulness for the individual
---
On an individual level, Mindfulness techniques enable us to defuse stress triggered by challenging situations and can help us to flourish in demanding working environments. We are all affected by the moods, speech and actions of other people. If we respond to the challenges we face more thoughtfully and compassionately, it can have a positive impact on the decisions we make, our wellbeing and those around us.
