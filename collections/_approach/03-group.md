title: Mindfulness for the group

We are social beings and how we think and feel is closely connected to the way we relate to others. Our approach uses the way we experience social interactions in the group to understand the connection between positive emotions, relationships and mindfulness and how we can foster these for the benefit of ourselves and others.
