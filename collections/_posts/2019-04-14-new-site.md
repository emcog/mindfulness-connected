This workshop will give mindfulness practitioners a practical and theoretical understanding of Mindfulness-Based Organisational Education (MBOE). Since the development of Mindfulness-Based Cogntive Therapy, mindfulness has entered the mainstream as a psychological therapy and as self-help. By contrast, MBOE recognises that stress is a natural response to modern working life and applies mindfulness to empower change. 

Mindfulness changes our relationship to thoughts and feelings but our sense of self is shaped by our relationships with others. As we are social beings, there is little point in changing our relationship to thoughts and feelings if this does not enable us to become more human. The MBOE programme combines group activities that explore how we create ideas about ourselves and others, short guided mindfulness meditations and group activities where people learn to describe subjective experience and listen to others.
