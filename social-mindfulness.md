## Are idealistic values naive and impractical? 

## Or is the belief that we are selfish beings who must compete to survive a toxic myth?

The prevailing narrative tells us that society provides the opportunity to improve our lot by developing skills that we sell for fair return in the marketplace. While we have succeeded in satisfying our material needs, many of us live unhappy, lonely lives. Mindfulness as self-help or therapy is effective at managing the stress of modern living, but this does not go to the root of 
the problem. 

‘Social mindfulness’ is a new approach that applies mindfulness to understand the social causes of stress and empower change. Mindfulness-Based Organisational Education (MBOE) combines mindfulness with a sense of relatedness to break the illusion of the separate self. This book explains the workings of the human, embodied social mind and how social mindfulness gives us the power to change the way things work.

%} Mark Leonard has searched for a means to make meditation accessible to a mass audience since the early 2000s. He played a key role in establishing the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, opened in 2008, and then adapted Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for the workplace. The result of a series of innovations, Mindfulness-Based Organisational Education represents a new approach to fostering social leadership and systemic change.
