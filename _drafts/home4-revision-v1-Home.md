    <h3>Bringing people together</h3>
    Mindfulness Connected training brings people together to use mindfulness techniques in a familiar workplace context. Clear, structured explanations, group exercises and short, guided mindfulness meditations help to explain how the <em>mind</em> works at the same time as providing opportunities for experiential learning.
    <h3>Mindfulness for the individual</h3>
    On an individual level, Mindfulness techniques enable us to defuse stress triggered by challenging situations and can help us to flourish in demanding working environments. We are all affected by the moods, speech and actions of other people. If we respond to the challenges we face more thoughtfully and compassionately, it can have a positive impact on the decisions we make, our wellbeing and those around us.
    <h3>Mindfulness for the group</h3>
    We are social beings and how we think and feel is closely connected to the way we relate to others. Our approach uses the way we experience social interactions in the group to understand the connection between positive emotions, relationships and mindfulness and how we can foster these for the benefit of ourselves and others.
    <h3>Evolution</h3>
    The Mindfulness Connected approach was developed from experience gained teaching "Frantic World" courses to CVS vets (the largest provider of veterinary services in the UK) combined with a social model of human experience. This takes mindfulness from its application as a therapy to a programme for personal development, leadership and organisational change.
