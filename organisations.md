## Our approach – An evidence-based organizational mindfulness programme

Little will change if mindfulness is merely applied as a means of coping with stress and enhancing individual performance. The Mindfulness Connected approach brings people together to apply ‘social mindfulness’ as a catalyst for change.

## The evidence
Our flagship programme, Mindfulness-Based Organisational Education (MBOE) has been tested under trial conditions with hospitals staff. It not only reduces stress, see Fig. 4 from the paper published in the journal, Mindfulness, but increases Basic Psychological Needs at Work Scale (BPNWS), see Fig. 3. BPNWS is a validated self-report scale from Self Determination Theory, which includes three elements: autonomy, competence and relatedness. This study has been published in the journal, Mindfulness making our programme
