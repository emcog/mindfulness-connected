Our evidence-based approach, _Mindfulness Based Organisational Education_ (MBOE), gives employees the tools to shape organisational culture with self-knowledge and a shared sense of purpose. Therapeutic mindfulness courses (MBSR, MBCT etc) are not effective in the workplace because they are too long, explain little and are designed as stress reduction tools for groups of individuals. People need a shared purpose to bring them together to cooperate, collaborate and achieve great outcomes.
